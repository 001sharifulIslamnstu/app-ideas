## App Ideas Collection

Did you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do?

Welcome to the **biggest collection** of app ideas you could build to improve your coding skills and why not, to impress your next employer with a shiny portfolio!

Not only that you'll find a list of projects but each project has the following features which will guide you through the process:

1. The main objective of the project
2. A list of minimal _User Stories_ which have to be implemented
3. A list of bonus features to improve the base project
4. A Trello Board that can be cloned and used to track your progress

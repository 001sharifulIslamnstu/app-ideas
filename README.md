## :ledger: App Ideas Collection

Have you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do? Just as
authors sometimes have "writers block" it's also true for developers. This list is intended to solve this issue once and for all! üëç

These applications are:

-   great to improve your coding skills :muscle:;
-   great to experiment with new technologies üÜï;
-   great to be added in your portfolio to impress your next employer/client :file_folder:;
-   great to be used as examples in tutorials (articles or videos) :page_with_curl:;
-   easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features :ok_hand:;

This is intended not only to be a simple list of projects, but a list that
describes each project in enough detail so you can develop it from the ground up!

Each project has the following **features**:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented; (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _To-Do's_. Fell free to add your own features if you want);
3. A list of bonus features that can improve the base project;
4. A Trello Board that can be cloned and used to track your progress;

## Trello Collection Boards

You can find a collection of all the Trello Boards containing a separate board for each project individually by clicking [here](https://trello.com/appideascollection). Clone the board and use it to track your progress on the project you are working.

## Plans for the future

We are planning in the future to add different _Levels_ or _Tiers_ for the projects. This way you will be able to find easier a project which is more suited for your coding skills. You can start with easier projects and advance to the harder ones.

## Contribution

Any contributions are highly appreciated. :pray: You can contribute in two ways:

1. create an issue and tell us your idea :bulb:. Make sure you use the **new idea** label in this case;
2. fork the project and submit a PR. Before doing that, please make sure that you are reading and following the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md);

### Examples

You can also add your own examples to the projects after you have completed them. I highly encourage you to do this as it will show others what amazing things you have built! üëç

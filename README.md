## App Ideas Collection

Welcome to the **biggest collection** of app ideas!

Did you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do? Just as
authors sometimes have "writers block" it's also true for developers.

These applications are:

-   great to improve your coding skills;
-   great to experiment with new technologies;
-   great to be added in your portofolio to impress your next employer/client;
-   great to be used as examples in tutorials (articles or videos);
-   easy to complete and also easily extendable with new features;

This is indended not only to be a simple list of projects, but a list that
describes each project in enough detail so you can develop it!

Each project has the following features:

1. A clear and descriptive objective;
2. A list of _User Stories_ which should be implemented; (these stories act more as a guideline than a forced list of _ToDo's_. Fell free to add your own features if you want)
3. A list of bonus features that can improve the base project;
4. A Trello Board that can be cloned and used to track your progress;

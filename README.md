## App Ideas Collection

Did you ever wanted to build something but you had no idea what to do? Are you sick of all the ToDo app ideas?

Welcome to the **biggest collection** of app ideas you could build to improve your coding skills and why not, to impress your next employer with a shiny portfolio!

Not only that you'll find a list of projects but each project has _User Stories_ (a list of ToDo's) which will guide you through the process.

Also, each project will have a Trello Board ready for you to clone and use to track your progress.

After you choose your project, make sure you clone the Trello Board corresponding to it.

## To Do

-   [ ] gather a list of projects to be added in the collection

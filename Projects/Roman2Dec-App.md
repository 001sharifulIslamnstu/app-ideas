# Roman2Dec

**Tier:** 1-Intermediate

The purpose of this app is to allow the user put in practice both, algorithmic and Web Development knowledge by creating a Roman to Decimal numbers converter app.

The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the 
usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. 
Roman numerals, as used today, employ seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value.

See the below table with *Symbol - Value*
 	
 	I - 1
 	V - 5
 	X - 10
 	L - 50
 	C - 100
 	D - 500
 	M - 1000

This challenge requires that the developer implementing it follow these
constraints:

-   Maximum decimal number that can be converted to Roman Numerals is within the range of 1 to 3999

## User Stories

-   [ ] User should enter one Roman number in an input field
-   [ ] The calculation must be done as the user type
-   [ ] User views the results in a single output field containing the
        decimal (base 10) equivalent of the the roman number that was entered.

## Bonus features
